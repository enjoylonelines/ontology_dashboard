# Decision Worker lifecycle implementation report — 2026-09-23

## Result

DecisionSession 실행을 API 요청 lifecycle과 분리하는 첫 vertical slice를 구현했다.

- server-owned `DecisionWorkerSupervisor`
- durable enqueue before dispatch
- async POST mode returning `202 Accepted`
- GET polling of the persisted run
- FastAPI startup worker start and shutdown drain/stop hooks
- explicit persisted-run resume API for a fresh service instance
- HTTP resume endpoint for operator-triggered requeue after restart
- JEV execution contract fields: job state, parse state, check state, completeness and provenance
- existing synchronous POST behavior preserved for compatibility

The product source is committed and pushed on `codex/decision-worker-lifecycle`.

## Changed source

- `systems/backend/app/operations/decision_worker.py`
  - owns worker id, pool creation, submit, active job snapshot and graceful stop
- `systems/backend/app/operations/decision_session_service.py`
  - durable `enqueue()`, persisted `resume()`, tenant-scoped `resume_pending()`, worker shutdown
  - queue creation time is separated from evidence `decision_as_of`
- `systems/backend/app/operations/router.py`
  - `execution_mode=async` returns 202 and a Location header
  - synchronous mode remains available
- `systems/backend/app/main.py`
  - startup starts the supervisor and configured periodic resumer
  - shutdown drains and stops workers/resumer
- `systems/backend/app/infra/db/decision_run_repository.py`
  - tenant/project-scoped pending-row enumeration using the database clock
- tests
  - `tests/test_decision_worker_supervisor.py`
  - async API coverage in `tests/test_decision_session_api.py`

## Verification

Command scope:

```text
tests/test_decision_durable_runner.py
tests/test_decision_durable_postgresql.py
tests/test_decision_session_api.py
tests/test_decision_session_service.py
tests/test_decision_worker_supervisor.py
tests/test_decision_support_agent.py
tests/test_decision_retry.py
tests/test_decision_planner_wire.py
```

Result: **46 passed** in 14.58 seconds for the focused suite; the resume endpoint slice adds **14 passed** in its API/service subset and the JEV state contract adds 2 focused cases.

The new API test verified:

1. async POST returns 202 with a server-owned worker id;
2. the response includes a durable session id and Location;
3. GET initially observes the queued/running state;
4. GET eventually observes the persisted completed proposal;
5. supervisor startup and shutdown complete without leaving active jobs;
6. a fresh service instance enumerates a pending row within the tenant scope and resumes it.

A first test failure exposed and fixed a real bug: enqueue used the evidence timestamp as the run creation timestamp, causing a durable result to appear expired. The queue now records the worker clock timestamp separately.

## What is now true

The API request no longer has to own the execution thread when `execution_mode=async` is selected. The server owns a worker supervisor, and PostgreSQL remains the durable run store. A caller can poll GET without resubmitting the workflow.

The sync route is intentionally preserved for compatibility. It is not the target production path for long-running runs.

The JEV redesign is now represented in the durable state and GET response: execution (`job_state`), parsing (`parse_state`), validation (`check_state`), completeness and provenance are independent fields. This is a contract change in how a result is judged, not an additional model layer.

## Remaining gap

This is not yet the complete production lifecycle.

- The supervisor queue is in-process; the durable row survives, and tenant-scoped pending enumeration plus `resume_pending()` now rebuilds the queue for a supplied identity scope.
- The periodic resumer is now lifecycle-owned and uses the explicit `DECISION_RESUMER_IDENTITIES` scope configuration; a broader dynamic tenant identity provider is still an operational follow-up.
- Fresh-process automatic recovery is covered for the configured scope in SQLite; PostgreSQL process-kill recovery, old-worker fencing under the new async path, and lease fault injection remain to be verified.
- JEV state transitions, completed execution with failed check, and incomplete evidence abstention are covered; parser/checker-specific failure injection and stronger completeness/provenance acceptance cases remain to be expanded.
- FastAPI lifecycle hooks currently use deprecated `on_event` APIs; the behavior is tested, but migration to a lifespan context should follow.
- The Career DB canonical PostgreSQL endpoint was not configured. The new seed was loaded into an isolated PostgreSQL 16 verification database after the existing project seed; DEC/PRB/EV/EXP relationship queries passed.
- Career DB decision-contract and review-state-machine tests passed against that isolated database.
- No canonical production/local Career DB transaction was claimed as applied.

## Career DB record

Prepared in the separate Career OS repository:

- `career-db/problems/PRB-ONTO-006.md`
- `career-db/decisions/DEC-ONTO-008.md`
- `career-db/evidence/EV-ONTO-006.md`
- `database/seeds/ontology_decision_worker_lifecycle_v0.1.sql`

They remain `review` / `partially_verified` until the canonical PostgreSQL seed transaction and automatic restart-resumer evidence are available. No claim has been promoted to `approved` based only on this implementation run.
